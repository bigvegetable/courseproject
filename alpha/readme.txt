This is alpha version of the library manage system.

There are some conventions about this system.

1.This system is created using Java programming language. It contains inner part dealing with mysql database and an outer GUI.

2.We use ustc.se.courseproject as our source code package, so all the sourcecode can be located under directory of 'ustc/se/courseproject/'. Under this directory, the 'db' subdirectory contains some data about the mysql database.
